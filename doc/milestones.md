# Milestones 

Time management is crucial for a successful thesis. You will work closely with me and your co-advisor(s) to establish a set of internal deadlines in order to make steady progress on your thesis. We will start from this working set of milestones, which are set by quarter.

| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Fall Q1 | Clarify Research Question <br> Collect & Read Main Papers| Summarize Related Work <br> Outline Methods | Identify Data <br> Summarize Data | 
| Fall Q2 | Identify Supporting Papers | Draft Background Chapter <br> Outline Methods Chapter | Reproduce Paper Results <br>  or Prototype New Ideas | 
| |
| Spring Q1 | Read Theses & Papers  <br> for Formatting Examples | Write Methods Chapter <br> Outline Main Results | Implement New Ideas &<br> Analyze Results |
| Spring Q2 | Find Papers that <br> Support/Refute Findings | Write Results & Discussion <br> Revisit All Chapters | Visualize Results | 


## Deadlines (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025)

You will submit thesis proposals in the middle of Week 2 and be assigned thesis advisors by the beginning of Week 3; refer to the Moodle page for more information (link TBD). 

We will start from these working set of deadlines for students starting thesis in the Fall of 2024. Deadlines may shift and they may be tailored to each project. We will also have smaller milestones for group meeting activities.

| Deadline | Milestone | Description | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Fall Week 4 (9/27) | Research Question | A document describing (a) a brief introduction to the topic, (b) the research question, and (c) why the question is important to study. Include at least two citations. |
| Fall Week  7 (10/18) <br> *Fall Break* | Annotated Bibliography | A document with a list of at least ten papers that are relevant to your project. For each paper, write one paragraph that (a) summarizes the main contributions of the paper and (b) explains why the paper is relevant to your question. |
| Fall Week 11 (11/22) | Methods Outline <br> & Updated Bibliography | An updated annotated bibliography with at least 15 papers and a document with a brief description of your methods. The methods outline can take many forms - it can be a list of steps you plan to do, pseudocode for existing or new methods, or instructions for running a tool. |
| Fall Week 14 (12/11) <br> *Winter Break* | Reflection | A document that describes (a) your current progress in thesis, (b) your planned progress for spring semester, and (c) your immediate next steps. Be sure to address your progress in **writing**, your progress in **reading**, and your progress in **experiments/analysis**. This is an opportunity to re-evaluate the thesis question or goal, and adjust if necessary.  |
| |
| Spring Week 4 (2/21) | Background & Methods Chapters in Thesis Template | **Move all of your existing drafts to one of the [thesis templates](https://www.reed.edu/it/help/thesis/#template).** Your thesis should have complete Background & Methods chapter drafts and ideally an outline of your results chapter. |
| Spring Week 8 (3/21) <br> *Spring Break* | Results & Discussion Outlines/Drafts | Outline your results in the thesis template, and add any results you currently have. Outline the main points you want to discuss in your Discussion chapter. | 
| Spring Week 11 (4/18) | Full Draft | Your thesis draft should have full drafts of all chapters. **This is the deadline to guarantee Anna's feedback - any writing after this date might not get edited.** |
| Spring Week 13 (5/2) | Thesis Due | Submit your approved thesis to the registrar before 3pm. | 


## Feedback

After submitting each milestone, you will receive feedback from me within one week in the form of edits directly on your document and, in some cases, a summary of your progress so far. 

**You can submit drafts for me to review at any time!** I will aim to get you edits within two weeks if you submit additional writing. Please send me reminders if you don't hear from me in these off-deadline editing requests.

As we get further into spring semester, I will focus on giving you feedback for parts that I have not read yet (rather than feedback on parts I've already edited). Note that your thesis must be approved by me before being submitted to the registrar, and I will require reviewing certain parts of the document (the Discussion, Results, etc.) before giving that approval.
