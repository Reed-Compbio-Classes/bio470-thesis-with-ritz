# Bio470: Thesis with Anna Ritz
_Last Updated September 2024 for students starting thesis in Fall 2024 or Spring 2025. Note that the details in this syllabus pertain only to students mentored by Anna Ritz; other faculty might have different guidance and requirements for thesis._

The CompBio lab uses computational tools to analyze patterns in large biological datasets; this can take thesis projects in a multitude of directions.  While a programming background is useful for some projects, other topics require no previous computer science experience (though you might learn some along the way). My main research uses molecular interaction networks, represented as graphs, to study intracellular signaling pathways and the ways in which they are disrupted in disease.  Thesis projects have studied the outputs of these tools to prioritize genes that may be associated with diseases, and have developed new ways of investigating these networks.

## Instructor Details

**Instructor:** Anna Ritz (she/her Biology 200B)

**General Office Hours:** Wednesday 1-2:30 and Friday 11-noon

**Thesis & Group Meetings:** TBD

**[Departmental Deadlines and Instructions are on the Moodle](https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=5598)**  

## Thesis Description & Goals

[The College describes the Reed thesis](https://www.reed.edu/academics/thesis.html) as "your opportunity to explore a problem or answer a question that holds particular significance to you."  This is manifested as a year-long, two-unit course where you pursue a biological question relevant to your major.  

The nature of the thesis project varies from student to student, as this is the most individualized course offered at Reed. In some cases, you will learn how to plan, execute, and interpret scientific experiments. In other cases, you will learn how to synthesize existing research to investigate and contextualize a new question. In all cases, you will learn how to **obtain and deepen your understanding of biological phenomena or processes** and how to **communicate the scientific knowledge** you gain, orally and in writing.  

The department has put together learning outcomes for thesis ([also found on Moodle](https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=5598)). Upon completing a senior thesis in Biology as student will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Choose and define important and contemporary topics of inquiry from the major field 
- Independently investigate that topic with the support of an advisor
- Develop new knowledge and/or ideas
- Apply a wide variety of skills learned in their coursework including active involvement in the development of hypotheses and in experimental design, methodological refinement, analysis and interpretation of data, discussion and criticism of research findings, and formal presentation of their work
- Apply ethical standards to research
- Write a coherent document that is substantially longer than a traditional term paper or project
- Defend their work orally to scientific and non-scientific audiences

## Thesis Evaluation

There are three parts to the thesis evaluation. We will work on all of these parts consistently throughout the year.

1. Engagement and progress with the project chosen/developed. We will have regular check-in meetings throughout the year.
2. The thesis document: a comprehensive summary of the thesis work, including a substantial background section with citations. You will write pieces of the thesis draft throughout the year.
3. An oral examination with a board of four faculty readers in accordance with the guidelines of your major, which occurs after the written thesis is submitted. You will practice communicating with others about your project throughout the year. 

The department has also written a statement about the thesis evaluation - [this can be found on Moodle](https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=5598).


### A Note on Co-Advised Theses and Thesis Scope
In some cases, your thesis may be advised by multiple faculty.  Any agreements made by all co-advisors, even if they deviate from this syllabus, are allowed.  For example, attending all meetings for all advisors may be untenable, or advisors may have different expectations in terms of internal deadlines.  Communication plans may differ when collaborating with multiple advisors.  When in doubt, defer to your collective advisors' advice over this document.  

**Make sure that your thesis satisfies the expectations of your major.**  BMB/Neuroscience/ES-Bio majors may want to confirm with a member of the relevant committee that their thesis falls within the expectations for the major. I encourage you to check in with the appropriate committee at least once before the thesis is due to make sure that your thesis is in scope.
